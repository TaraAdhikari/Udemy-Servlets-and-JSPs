1. Difference between getAttribute() and getParameter()
    Ans: A. --getParameter() returns http request parameters. Those passed from the client to the server.
                              For example http://example.com/servlet?parameter=1. Can only return String
            --getAttribute() is for server-side usage only - you fill the request with attributes that you can use within the same request.
                      For example - you set an attribute in a servlet, and read it from a JSP. Can be used for any object, not just string.
         B. ---The return type for attributes is an Object, whereas the return type for a parameter is a String. When calling the
                getAttribute(String name) method, bear in mind that the attributes must be cast.

1. Difference between getAttribute() and getParameter()
    Ans: A. --getParameter() returns http request parameters. Those passed from the client to the server.
                              For example http://example.com/servlet?parameter=1. Can only return String
            --getAttribute() is for server-side usage only - you fill the request with attributes that you can use within the same request.
                      For example - you set an attribute in a servlet, and read it from a JSP. Can be used for any object, not just string.
         B. ---The return type for attributes is an Object, whereas the return type for a parameter is a String. When calling the
                getAttribute(String name) method, bear in mind that the attributes must be cast.
         
2. Difference between include and forward mechanism for request dispatching concept?
      Ans: A. --The main difference is that when you use forward the control is transferred to the next servlet/jsp you are calling,
                while include retains the control with the current servlet, it just includes the processing done by the calling 
                servlet/jsp(like doing any out.println or other processing).
           B. --include: will include another file in our current file
                forward: will forward the current request to the forwarding page
           C. --Assume you have two pages, pageA, and pageB. In pageA you wrote the include tag. In this case the control was in pageA
                til you called the include tag. At this point the full control goes to pageB. When It's done, control is returned to pageA
                starting from the next point of coding after the include tag and continuing to the rest of pageA.
                
                Well, to get things much clearer, let's say that we have the same pages, pageA and pageB, but this time we will use the
                forward tag in pageA, not the include tag. Again, the control will begin in pageA till we call the forward tag in pageA,
                at this point, control is transfered to pageB, just like the include tag. But the difference is what happens when pageB 
                completes. In case of the forward tag, control doesn't go back to pageA again.
           D. --The key difference between the two is that the forward() method will CLOSE the output stream after it has been invoked, 
                whereas the include method leaves the output stream OPEN.
                answering with an example : lets have a servlet page named xxx.java and a jsp page named yy.jsp

                In the yy.jsp

                WELCOME to yy.jsp
                In the xxx.java //using forward()

                RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("yy.jsp");
                    rd.forward(request,response);
                    out.println("back to servlet"); //this wont b displayed

                output

                WELCOME to yy.jsp 
                In the xxx.java //using include()

                RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("yy.jsp");
                      rd.include(request,response);
                      out.println("back to servlet");

                output

                WELCOME to yy.jsp back to servlet
